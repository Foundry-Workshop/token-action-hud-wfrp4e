## Features
- Make rolls directly from the HUD instead of opening your character sheet.
- Use items from the HUD or right-click an item to open its sheet.
- Move the HUD and choose to expand the menus up or down.
- Unlock the HUD to customise layout and groups per user, and actions per actor.
- Add your own macros, journal entries and roll table compendiums.
